# Predicting Conflict

Predicting Conflict using a variety of economic and socioeconomic factors.

## Project Definition

### Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict when a future conflict might arise based on certain economic and socioeconomic indicators.

### Definition of Conflict

For the purposes of this project, "conflict" will be defined as an armed confrontation between nation-states, or between a nation-state and non-state actors, that results in significant casualties or political impact. This definition will include wars such as WW1, WW2, Vietnam, Korea, as well as military interventions such as the Gulf War, Afghanistan War, or Iraq War. Additionally, political and social unrest may be considered as potential indicators of conflict, as these can lead to military action or international tensions. Please note that this definition is specific to the context of the USA and may be refined or adjusted as the project progresses.

### Expected Outcome

The expected outcome of the project is a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a conflict based on the selected economic and socioeconomic indicators.

## Data Collection

### Data Sources

The data sources that will be used for this project will be identified based on previous research and domain expertise. These may include, but are not limited to:

- The World Bank: The World Bank provides a wide range of data on economic and social development, including indicators such as GDP, poverty rates, education levels, and health outcomes. The World Development Indicators (WDI) and the Global Economic Monitor (GEM) are two such databases.
- The United Nations: The United Nations (UN) provides data on a variety of economic and social issues through its various specialized agencies and programs, such as the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Statistics Division, and the International Labour Organization (ILO). The UN also publishes reports on topics such as human development, gender equality, and sustainable development.
- International Monetary Fund (IMF): IMF provides data on economic indicators, including GDP, inflation rates, and trade flows, from countries around the world.
- Transparency International: The Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International provides data on corruption levels in countries around the world.
- United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR): The UNHCR provides data on forced displacement, including refugees and internally displaced persons.
- Human Rights Watch: Human Rights Watch is an international non-governmental organization that provides data on human rights violations around the world.
- International Crisis Group: International Crisis Group provides analysis and data on conflicts and potential conflicts around the world.
- Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED): ACLED provides data on conflict events, actors, and their attributes for countries in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East.
- Social Progress Index: The Social Progress Index is a global index that measures the social and environmental outcomes of countries.

### Data Collection and Cleaning

### Indicators for Conflict Prediction

The specific economic and socioeconomic indicators that will be used to predict conflicts will be identified based on previous research and domain expertise. These indicators may include, but are not limited to:

#### Economic Indicators

- Gross domestic product (GDP)
- Income inequality
- Unemployment rate
- Poverty rate
- Stock market indices (e.g. Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500)
- Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- Producer Price Index (PPI)
- Trade balance (exports minus imports)
- Federal funds rate (interest rate set by the Federal Reserve)
- National debt and budget deficit
- Real estate prices
- Crude oil production
- Crude oil imports and exports
- Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) levels
- Oil consumption and demand
- Gasoline prices
- Dependence on primary commodity exports

#### Socioeconomic Indicators

- Education level
- Access to healthcare
- Crime rate
- Political instability
- Military expenditure
- Ethnic and religious tensions
- Infant mortality rate
- Primary school completion rate
- Political rights
- Ethnic fractionalization
- Low education levels
- Weak state institutions
- Measures of social cohesion
- Natural resource availability
- Human rights violations

#### Business and Industry Indicators

- Consumer and business confidence indices
- Manufacturing and services sector indices

Keep in mind that some of these may be highly correlated, and are only initial thoughts as to what indicators might be included. These have not been based on prior research as of writing (2023-03-25).
