# Predicting Conflict

Predicting Conflict using a variety of economic and socioeconomic factors.

## Project Definition

### Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict when a future conflict might arise based on certain economic and socioeconomic indicators.

### Definition of Conflict

For the purposes of this project, "conflict" will be defined as an armed confrontation between nation-states, or between a nation-state and non-state actors, that results in significant casualties or political impact. This definition will include wars such as WW1, WW2, Vietnam, Korea, as well as military interventions such as the Gulf War, Afghanistan War, or Iraq War. Additionally, political and social unrest may be considered as potential indicators of conflict, as these can lead to military action or international tensions. Please note that this definition is specific to the context of the USA and may be refined or adjusted as the project progresses.

### Expected Outcome

The expected outcome of the project is a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a conflict based on the selected economic and socioeconomic indicators.

## Data Collection

### Data Sources

The data sources that will be used for this project will be identified based on previous research and domain expertise. These may include, but are not limited to:

- The World Bank: The World Bank provides a wide range of data on economic and social development, including indicators such as GDP, poverty rates, education levels, and health outcomes. The World Development Indicators (WDI) and the Global Economic Monitor (GEM) are two such databases.
